# Git Tests

Just a quick repo to:

1. check I actually learned how to use this
2. see if I forgot anything
3. waste more time in tutorial hell.

can now: 
1. init a local git repo
2. link to a github repo
3. change contents of file and push to git
4. view repo version history using git log
5. git checkout old-version
6. git branch -M new-branch
7. git checkout new-branch
8. edit new branch
9. git merge main
10. git pull any changes made by other people or myself on github repo
